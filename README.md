- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-demelash/

I started learning Flutter during my time at university and have enjoyed working with it ever since. I have a strong ability to translate UI designs into pixel-perfect implementations. For showcase, you can see my LuxeShop app repository which I built based on a Dribbble design. Here is the ![Github link](https://github.com/DANIEL-DEMELASH/luxeshop_ui) and ![Dribbble link](https://dribbble.com/shots/24409190-Luxeshop-Ecommerce-Mobile-App).

I am proficient in integrating RESTful APIs into Flutter applications. As a demonstration of these skills, I built a demo application called á‰…á‹³áˆœ áŒˆá‰¢á‹« (Saturday Market), which uses the Fakestore API for data and Bloc state management to ensure efficient functionality. Here is the ![Github link](https://github.com/DANIEL-DEMELASH/kidame_gebiya) and ![API link](https://fakestoreapi.com/)

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Daniel Demelash
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Mobile App Development
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Flutter

I started learning Flutter during my time at university and have enjoyed working with it ever since. I have a strong ability to translate UI designs into pixel-perfect implementations. For showcase, you can see my [LuxeShop app repository](https://github.com/DANIEL-DEMELASH/luxeshop_ui) which I built based on [this Dribbble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/24409190-Luxeshop-Ecommerce-Mobile-App).

I am proficient in integrating RESTful APIs into Flutter applications. As a demonstration of these skills, I built a demo application called [á‰…á‹³áˆœ áŒˆá‰¢á‹« (Saturday Market)](https://github.com/DANIEL-DEMELASH/kidame_gebiya), which uses the [Fakestore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) for data and Bloc state management to ensure efficient functionality.
